Alright, folks, get ready to hear about my journey as a freelancer! I’ve been hustling for the past 14 years in Switzerland as a software engineer, tech lead, and engineering manager. I’ve worked for a bunch of different companies, from pension funds to real estate to the public sector. My go-to tech stack is .NET / .NET Core, AWS and Azure, with a dash of frontend frameworks like Angular, Vue, MVC, and some libraries like React thrown in there. After all that hard work and building up a network in Bern, I realized it was time to give freelancing a try - fingers crossed I make enough to feed my family too!
